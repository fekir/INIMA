= INIMA

INIMA stands for INIt MAchine (it also apparently means https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inim%C4%83[heart] in Romanian).
It is a collection of scripts, notes and references on how to configure operating systems (primary modern windows and debian-based systems).

Setting up a computer or virtual machine always takes a lot of effort and time, it's easy to forget to configure something, and after a couple of weeks noone knows how the machine has be configured.

On most Linux systems it is easy to automate most of the stuff, so I've begun to collect various command used for setting my environments up.

In the last years, tools like docker and packer emerged, providing the ability to ease the creation of virtual environments.

I decided therefore to resurrect, polish and update some of my old scripts and notes.
